abstract = {Xenotransplantation is a potential option for individuals for whom an acceptable human allograft is unavailable. Individuals with broadly reactive HLA antibodies due to prior exposure to foreign HLA are potential candidates for a clinical xenotransplant trial. It remains controversial if allosensitisation results in the development of cross-reactive antibodies against SLA. This may require increased histocompatibility scrutiny for highly sensitised individuals prior to enrollment in a clinical trial. Serum samples were obtained from non-human primates sensitised via serial skin transplantation from maximally MHC-mismatched donor, as reported. Sera from pre- and post-allosensitisation timepoints were assessed in a flow crossmatch (FXM) for IgM and IgG binding to pig splenocytes with or without red blood cell adsorption. Xenoreactive antibodies were eluted from pig splenocytes and screened on a single antigen HLA bead assay. A MHC Matchmaker algorithm was developed to predict potential conserved amino acid motifs among the pig, NHP, and human. Our sensitised NHP model was used to demonstrate that allosensitisation does not result in an appreciable difference in xenoreactive antibody binding in a cell-based FXM. However, antibody elution and screening on single antigen HLA beads suggest the existence of potential cross-reactive antibodies against SLA. The cross-reactive IgG after allosensitisation were predicted by comparing the recipient Mamu alleles against its previous allograft donor Mamu alleles and the donor pig SLA alleles. Our study suggests that allosensitisation could elevate cross-reactive antibodies, but a more sensitive assay than a cell-based FXM is required to detect them. The MHC Matchmaker algorithm was developed as a potential tool to help determine amino acid motif conservation and reactivity pattern.},

As a result of recent advances in sequencing technologies, huge numbers of biological sequences are available and the need for MSAs with large numbers of sequences is increasing. To extract biologically relevant information from such data, sophistication of algorithms is necessary but not sufficient. Intuitive and interactive tools for experimental biologists to semiautomatically handle large data are becoming important. We are working on development of MAFFT toward these two directions. Here, we explain (i) the Web interface for recently developed options for large data and (ii) interactive usage to refine sequence data sets and MSAs.}",

  abstract = {Knowing protein secondary and other one-dimensional structural properties are essential for accurate protein structure and function prediction. As a result, many methods have been developed for predicting these one-dimensional structural properties. However, most methods relied on evolutionary information that may not exist for many proteins due to a lack of sequence homologs. Moreover, it is computationally intensive for obtaining evolutionary information as the library of protein sequences continues to expand exponentially. Here, we developed a new single-sequence method called SPOT-1D-Single based on a large training dataset of 39 120 proteins deposited prior to 2016 and an ensemble of hybrid long-short-term-memory bidirectional neural network and convolutional neural network.We showed that SPOT-1D-Single consistently improves over SPIDER3-Single and ProteinUnet for secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact number and backbone angles prediction for all seven independent test sets (TEST2018, SPOT-2016, SPOT-2016-HQ, SPOT-2018, SPOT-2018-HQ, CASP12 and CASP13 free-modeling targets). For example, the predicted three-state secondary structure's accuracy ranges from 72.12\% to 74.28\% by SPOT-1D-Single, compared to 69.1--72.6\% by SPIDER3-Single and 70.6--73\% by ProteinUnet. SPOT-1D-Single also predicts SS3 and SS8 with 6.24\% and 6.98\% better accuracy than SPOT-1D on SPOT-2018 proteins with no homologs (Neff\,=\,1), respectively. The new method's improvement over existing techniques is due to a larger training set combined with ensembled learning.Standalone-version of SPOT-1D-Single is available at https://github.com/jas-preet/SPOT-1D-Single. Direct prediction can also be made at https://sparks-lab.org/server/spot-1d-single. The datasets used in this research can also be downloaded from GitHub.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
